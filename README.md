# Simple Melody
This is my Mom's version of Do-Re-Mi that she would sing to my as a child. It is slower than the original.

# Sound Design Project: 
This is a good path for sound design for beginners.
Personally, I wasnâ€™t too familiar with music theory and Professor Conrad went through a technique for people struggling with. I wanted to develop a Trumpet and Professor Conrad suggested a method using FM synthesis. Here is the steps I took and how to replicate.
1. Open FM synthesis
2. Go to the idx1 value and start moving it left and right (binary search) until you get a sound that is closer to a trumpet.

3. Repeat the above step for idx2 and idx3.
4. Look through a website like https://www.javelinart.com/FM_Synthesis_of_Real_Instruments.pdf to see specifics about the instrument. For example, a trumpet sounds brighter when it plays louder notes. idx3 makes the trumpet sound brighter so have this be modified when amplitude changes. I used a factor of 10 times amplitude for the trumpet to accomplish this. Often, there will be more information regarding the use of carMul, modMul, and pan but for a lot of instruments using the preexisting settings works as expected.

Some examples of instruments values:

# Final Project:
## Imperial March by John Williams
Alto Saxophone, Clarinet, Tuba, Bass Drum, Snare Drum with FM synthesis
1083 Midi Notes

For this project, I wanted to arrange a piece but the Synth files looked awful for writing music in a clean fashion when multiple instruments are being used. I developed a python script to write music in a simpler manner. Then, the melody was developed. After you run the python script you can copy and paste it into a Synth file and run. Then run using the FM Synthesis cpp file.
